# CFA-Research-Challenge-Poland-2021
Representing the Polish team, we presented fundamental and technical analysis of Allegroâ€™s finances and stock to Allegro representatives at the time of their IPO.

Our recommendation was to hold the stock because of multiple factors that led us to believe that the stock was undervalued right before the IPO launch and our forecast was considered correct.
